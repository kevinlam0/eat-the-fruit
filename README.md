# Eat the Fruit

This personal project was about the player manually putting in inputs to eat the fruits.

The inspiration of this game is from snake, but I wanted to add a personal spin to it by progressively reducing the window size. 

The dimensions of the wall corresponds to the level. 

A level go until 5 fruits are eaten to continue on to the next level.

This game features a restart option, manual inputs to move on to the next level, score board, visual components, and randomized locations of the fruit within the window. 

Additionally, this game uses the uvage.py as an game engine.
