## Game Information/Features
  - The inspiration of this game is from snake, but I wanted to add a personal spin to it by progressively reducing the window size and increasing the speed of the gamebox
  - The walls' dimensions corresponds with the levels where the window is smaller as the level goes on, and this allows easy implentation of more levels
  - Manual inputs of the arrow keys to move 
  - This game features a restart option, manual inputs to move on to the next level, score board, visual components, and randomized locations of the fruit within the window.

## Game Rules
  - "Eat" 5 fruits to continue to the next level
  - If the user touches the walls, the game will end
  - Use the arrow keys to move the gamebox
